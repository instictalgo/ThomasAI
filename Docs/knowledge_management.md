# Knowledge Management System

The Thomas AI Knowledge Management System is designed to help game development teams collect, organize, and leverage game design knowledge. This system serves as a centralized repository for game design concepts, industry practices, educational resources, and market research.

## Overview

The knowledge management system consists of several components:

1. **Knowledge Base**: A structured database that stores different types of game design knowledge
2. **Knowledge Manager Interface**: A user interface for adding, viewing, and searching knowledge
3. **Document Uploader**: A tool for extracting knowledge from game design documents
4. **API Endpoints**: Programmatic access to the knowledge base

## Accessing the Knowledge Manager

To access the Knowledge Manager:

1. Launch the Thomas AI dashboard
2. Click on "Knowledge" in the sidebar navigation
3. The Knowledge Manager interface will be displayed

## Knowledge Types

The system organizes knowledge into four main categories:

### Game Design Concepts

Game design concepts include fundamental principles, mechanics, systems, and patterns used in game development.

Examples:
- Core gameplay loops
- Progression systems
- Balancing techniques
- Level design principles

### Industry Practices

Industry practices document successful approaches, methodologies, and workflows used by game development studios.

Examples:
- Agile development for game teams
- QA testing methodologies
- Live service update strategies
- Community management approaches

### Educational Resources

Educational resources catalog learning materials that can help team members improve their skills and knowledge.

Examples:
- Books on game design
- Online courses
- Tutorial videos
- Development tools and documentation

### Market Research

Market research tracks trends, player preferences, and competitive analysis to inform game development decisions.

Examples:
- Genre popularity trends
- Monetization models analysis
- Player demographic studies
- Competitor feature analysis

## Using the Knowledge Manager

### Adding Knowledge Manually

To add knowledge manually:

1. Select the appropriate knowledge type from the sidebar
2. Click on the "Add New..." expander
3. Fill in the required information
4. Click the "Add" button to save the entry

### Searching the Knowledge Base

To search for knowledge:

1. Select the appropriate knowledge type from the sidebar
2. Enter your search query in the search box
3. View the results displayed below
4. Click on any result to expand and see the full details

### Using the Document Uploader

The Document Uploader allows you to extract knowledge from game design documents, research papers, and other materials.

To use the Document Uploader:

1. Select "Document Uploader" from the sidebar
2. Choose the document type from the dropdown
3. Upload your document (supported formats: PDF, DOCX, TXT)
4. Enter your OpenAI API key (required for document analysis)
5. Click "Extract Knowledge" to process the document
6. Review the extracted knowledge
7. The knowledge will be automatically saved to the knowledge base

## API Access

The knowledge base can be accessed programmatically through the following API endpoints:

### Adding Knowledge

- `POST /knowledge/design-concept`: Add a game design concept
- `POST /knowledge/industry-practice`: Add an industry practice
- `POST /knowledge/educational-resource`: Add an educational resource
- `POST /knowledge/market-research`: Add market research

### Searching Knowledge

- `POST /knowledge/search`: Search the knowledge base

## Integration with Thomas AI Assistant

The knowledge management system is integrated with the Thomas AI Assistant, allowing it to:

1. Provide more informed responses about game design topics
2. Reference specific game design concepts, practices, and research
3. Learn from conversations about game design
4. Suggest relevant educational resources

## Best Practices

For optimal use of the knowledge management system:

1. **Be Specific**: When adding knowledge, provide detailed descriptions and examples
2. **Include References**: Whenever possible, include sources and references
3. **Use Consistent Terminology**: Maintain consistent naming conventions for concepts
4. **Regular Updates**: Periodically review and update the knowledge base
5. **Categorize Properly**: Ensure knowledge is added to the appropriate category

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Document Upload Fails**: Ensure the document is in a supported format and not password-protected
- **Extraction Returns Limited Results**: Try breaking larger documents into smaller, more focused files
- **Search Returns No Results**: Try using different keywords or more general terms
- **API Key Issues**: Verify that your OpenAI API key is valid and has sufficient quota

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the knowledge management system include:

- Integration with external knowledge sources
- Collaborative knowledge editing
- Knowledge visualization tools
- Automated knowledge suggestions
- Version history for knowledge entries
